              We&apos;re a team of web developers, united by a common goal: to create an e-Commerce
              application. This project is not only our first experience of collaboration but also

              Our journey into React development has been both challenging and rewarding. As we dove
              into the intricacies of React components and hooks, we found ourselves continuously
              learning and adapting to new methodologies. Also, this project has allowed us to
              experiment with state management techniques, pushing our development skills to new
              heights.

                Although we three were strangers at the start of the project, this did not prevent
                us from quickly establishing a collaborative rapport. We quickly recognized each
                other&apos;s strengths and weaknesses, which helped us navigate through all the
                challenges of team development. The toughest part of the project involved grappling
                with the Commercetools platform and its SDK, often joking about the complexity and
                unpredictability of its documentation. However, over each iteration we developed
                more suitable and reusable solutions. This experience boosted our confidence in
                using Git and code review. You can check out the code for our application at the
                provided link.
