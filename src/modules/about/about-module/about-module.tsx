        About Us

      <Box sx={{ textAlign: 'center', maxWidth: 800, margin: '0 auto' }}>
        <p>
          We&apos;re a team of web developers, united by a common goal: to create an e-Commerce
          application. This project is not only our first experience of collaboration but also our
          first try into React development.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our journey into React development has been both challenging and rewarding. As we dove
          into the intricacies of React components and hooks, we found ourselves continuously
          learning and adapting to new methodologies. Also, this project has allowed us to
          experiment with state management techniques, pushing our development skills to new
          heights.
